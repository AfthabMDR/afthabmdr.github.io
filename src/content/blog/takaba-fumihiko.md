Takaba Fumihiko is a character from the manga series Jujutsu Kaisen. Initially we all thought he was just a character introduced for comic relief during the culling game arc, but later in the series we got to know how powerful he really is. In this article, I will discuss why Takaba Fumihiko should be considered a special grade sorcerer, along with Gojo, Geto, and Yuta.

### What are grades of sorcerers?

In the Jujutsu Kaisen universe, sorcerers and curses are classified into different grades based on their abilities and power levels. 
Jujutsushis(Jujutsu sorcerers) are assigned to take on curses that are a grade below them. So a grade 1 sorcerer can take on grade 2 curses, but not grade 1 curses(although there are exceptions).

The grades of sorcerers are as follows:  

**Grade 4:** Weakest tier of sorcerers. Maki Zenin is the only known grade 4 sorcerer in the series, but that's only because her promotion was being delayed by the higher-ups in the Zenin clan.  

**Grade 3:** Mostly students at Jujutsu High. They are still learning and honing their skills. Known grade 3 sorcerers are Kugisaki Nobara and Mai Zenin.  

**Semi-grade 2:** Panda is the only known semi-grade 2 sorcerer in the series. He is a special case because he is a cursed corpse.  

**Grade 2:** Above average sorcerers. It's considered exceptional for a student to reach this level. Examples are Takuma Ino and Fusiguro Megumi.  

**Semi-grade 1:** Rank for sorcerers who have been recommended for promotion to grade 1. Inumaki Toge, Kamo Noritoshi, Kokichi Muta(Mechamaru), and Utahime Iori come under this category.  

**Grade 1:** Highest rank a sorcerer can hope to achive through normal means. They are the elite of the sorcerer world. Most of the fan favorites like Kento Nanami, Mei Mei, and Todo Aoi are grade 1 sorcerers. They are the ones who are fit to lead the jujutsu world, as special grade sorcerers are anomalies. 

**Special grade:** Highest tier of sorcerers in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. They are extremely powerful and have the ability to take on curses that are beyond the capabilities of first grade sorcerers. Special grade sorcerers are rare and are considered to be anomalies in the sorcerer world. The known special grade sorcerers are Gojo Satoru, Geto Suguru, Yuki Tsukumo, and Yuta Okkotsu. Sukuna, the King of Curses, can also be considered a special grade sorcerer before he turned into a curse himself.

### What differentiates a special grade sorcerer from a grade 1 sorcerer?

A notable distinction to be made between grade 1 and special grade sorcerers is that grade 1 sorcerers are not supposed to take on special grade curses. It's obvious from how Kento Nanami, along with Naobito Zenin, Maki Zenin, and Megumi Fushiguro, were struggling against a single special grade curse, Dagon, in the Shibuya Incident arc, and had to be rescued by the reincarnated Toji Fushiguro.  

To put it bluntly, special grade sorcerers are ridiculously OP from the get go. They are the ones who can take on special grade curses without breaking a sweat. We can see this from how Gojo delivered his iconic line "You're weak" to Jogo, and ripping his head off like it was nothing, while a group of Grade one sorcerers were almost killed by him.
Yuta Okkotsu, the protagonist of the prequel series Jujutsu Kaisen 0, finished off Maelstrom, the combination of a special grade curse and all the curses Geto had absorbed, with the help of Rika Orimoto.
Geto Suguru had the ability to control even special grade curses, making him one of the most dangerous sorcerers in the series. 

We can summarize the key points that make a special grade sorcerer as follows:
- Ability to take on special grade curses without much effort.
- Anomalous power that cannot be attained just by training hard.


### Who is Takaba Fumihiko?
Takaba Fumihiko was introduced in the culling game arc of JJK. He was a failed comedian who turned into a curse user as a player for the culling game. He has a goofy aa personality, and his jokes weren't funny to most people. Most cursed techniques given to non curse users during the culling game was based on the person's emotions and situations. For example, Hiruguma Hito, a defense attorney with a strong sense of justice, got the cursed technique based on court trials, with a shikigami as the judge. In the case of Takaba, his cursed technique was based on his desire to make people laugh. He could make a joke out of anything, and literally anything. Simple as that. Which is also what makes his cursed technique so powerful.
